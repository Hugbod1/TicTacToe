## Design Report
##### About

The project is designed as a Java app. It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game for two players competing on the same screen, or one player against a computer oponent.

##### Environment
The *Hugboð* team retrived the source code through a shared repository on Github. The following development environments were used by the project member:
- Windows 8 - Local Gitbash
- Ubuntu 15.04 - Local terminal 
- OS X - Qstack a virtual machine from Advania 
- Windows 10 - Qstack virtual machine from Advania

Two of our deveolpers used the Advania virtual machine and the rest used their local machine. 

We decided to develop the project on both local- and virtual machines to make it more challenging for the team to harmonize, and of course to be sure that it would run on both machines. This was made simple with the use of github.

##### Class Diagram for Tic Tac Toe

The intention for the class TicTacToe is to contain the elements affecting and communicating with the Jframe user interface while having the Service class handle the business logic of the game.
