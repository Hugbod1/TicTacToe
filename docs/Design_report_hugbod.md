## Design Report
##### About

The application was designed on a web-based platform. The project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game were there can be two players or just one player competing against the computer.

##### Environment
The *Hugboð* team retrived the source code through a shared repository on Github. Not all team mebers used the same environment on their computer. the following are the environments that where used:
- Windows 8 - Local Gitbash
- Ubuntu 15.04 - Local terminal 
- OS X - Qstack a virtual machine from Advania 
- Windows 10 - Qstack virtual machine from Advania

Two of our deveolpers used the virtual machine and the rest used their local machine. 

We decided to develope the project on both local- and virtual machines to make it more challenging for the team to harmonize, and of course to be sure that it would run on both machines. It turned out to be actually quite simple, which tells us that the approach that is taught and used for this project is a very good for source control.

The intention for the class TicTacToe is to contain the game loop as well as the elements affecting and communicating with the Jframe user interface. The Service class should handle the business logic of the game.
